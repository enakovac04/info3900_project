## Action Items

1. Has your group been able to get into contact with everyone in the group? (yes/no)

**Answer**: Yes, we had our first meeting on Saturday (11/15) and our second meeting on Wednesday (11/19) so far.

2. What is the treatment and outcome your group is considering. What are the variable names in ADD Health?

**Answer**: Our treatment is going to be Waist size. 
Our outcome is going to be resting heart rate which is an indicator of general health and fitness.
Treatment variable name: H5_WAIST_CM which is in Wave V Anthropometrics as H5WAIST or H5WSTCLS
Outcome variable name: H5_PULSE1, H5_PULSE2, H5_PULSE3 These variables are available in Add Health Wave 5 and can be used to study whether people with larger waist sizes have higher resting heart rates. Can also find in Wave V Cardiovascular Measures - H5Q033 (that’s Pulse 1).

3. Write 1-2 sentences describing your group's plan for Data processing. Refer to the instructions on the course website for more details.

**Answer**: In our group, Alex, Alexa, and Ena will be collaborating together on the data cleaning and processing. Our first goal is to isolate and import the data successfully. We will then check in via another Zoom meeting by Monday Nov 19 (11/19, 4:30 PM) to determine next steps especially with regards to cleaning. 

4. Write 1-2 sentences describing your group's plan for the Analysis strategy. Refer to the instructions on the course website for more details.

**Answer**: We will use matching to analyze our data's potential causal effect. In our group, Ena will work on identification (drawing the DAG and determining conditional exchangeability). She’ll work with Alexa and Alex to make sure the variables are in the dataset to use in matching. They plan to finish this by Nov 19th. Everyone (Ena, Alexa, & Alex) will work on conducting the matching in R, starting Nov 19th.

6. What is the next date your group is planning to check in on progress (either via a meeting or through a groupchat).

**Answer**: We have a groupchat that we will keep each other up to date. We also have a github repo in order for us all to work collaboratively on the project. Our current plan is to meet on 11/19 and determine the next time after that we will meet.
